//Brute Force Approach
//Time Complexity - O(N^3)
//Space Complexity - O(1)
//Consider all possible subarrays. -O(N^2)
//Find the sum of all the elements in that particular subarray and update ans. -O(N)

//Better Approach
//Time Complexity - O(N^2)
//Space Complexity - O(N)
//Create a prefix array of sum. Sum of all the elements present in a subarray can be computed in O(1) time using this prefix array
//Or we can take a sum variable initialized with 0 in the beginning of j loop and add to it the element at jth position. So the space complexity - O(1) 

//Optimal Approach
//Time Complexity - O(N)
//Space Complexity - O(1)
//Kadane's Algorithm
//The simple idea of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (curr_sum is used for this). 
//And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_sum is used for this). 
//Each time we get a positive-sum compare it with max_sum and update max_sum if it is greater than max_sum.
