//As we know a âŠ• a = 0. When we write all substrings, we have to check how many numbers occur an even number of times and how many numbers occur an odd number of times. 
//If the list is 0 indexed, the number at ith index will occur (i + 1) * (N - i) times.
//If N is even, either i + 1 or N - i will be even. Each number will occur an even number of times, and the answer will be 0 .
//If N is odd and i is even, the product of the XOR will be odd. In that case, the answer is the XOR of the even indexed elements.
