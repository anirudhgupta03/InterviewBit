for 1st iteration loop will iterate n times…

for 2nd iteration loop will iterate n/2 times…
for 3rd iteration loop will iterate n/4 times…
for 4th iteration loop will iterate n/8 times… and so on…
so here O(f(n)) = n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + n/16 + …
=> O(f(n)) = n + 1/2( n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + n/16 + …)
=> O(f(n)) = n + 1/2O(f(n))
=> 1/2O(f(n)) = n
=> O(f(n)) = 2n
therefore time complexity will be O(n)
